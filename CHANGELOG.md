# Changelog

All notable changes to Seamless-RAG are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Docs: Seamless-RAG took 🥈 2nd place at the [MariaDB Hackathon Malaysia
  2026](https://crestsolution.com/resources/events-and-albums/mariadb-hackathon-malaysia-2026/)**,
  organized by the MariaDB Foundation and Crest Infosolutions. README, docs
  site, and Judges' Testing Guide updated with the result; test-count badges
  refreshed from the live `make score` run.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- **`GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` / `VERTEX_AI_API_KEY` are now
  recognized in `.env`.** Previously `Settings` only read
  `EMBEDDING_API_KEY` and `LLM_API_KEY`, so users who copied a key
  named with any of the three Google conventions found it silently
  ignored — the bare `AQ.…` Vertex Express key worked fine, but only
  if you knew to rename the env var. All three Google-side names are
  now `validation_alias` choices on both `embedding_api_key` and
  `llm_api_key`. The canonical names still take precedence when both
  are set. Backward compatible — existing `.env` files keep working.
  Locked in by 10 regression tests in `tests/unit/test_config.py`.
- **`text-embedding-004` (Gemini) is no longer rewritten to
  `gemini-embedding-001`.** The factory's foreign-model detection used
  `_OPENAI_PREFIXES = ("text-embedding-",)`, which is too broad: Google
  also ships `text-embedding-004`, `text-embedding-005`, and
  `text-multilingual-embedding-002` under the same prefix. A user
  picking `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=gemini` + `EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-004`
  was silently coerced back to the default Gemini model. Tightened to
  the OpenAI-only suffixes (`text-embedding-3-`, `text-embedding-ada-`)
  so the generic `text-embedding-NNN` family stays with Gemini where
  it belongs. Locked in by 5 prefix tests in
  `tests/unit/test_provider_factory.py`.

### Documented

- **CONTRIBUTING.md gained a "Troubleshooting: editable install +
  Python 3.14 + sandboxed shells" section.** Some sandboxes (the Bash
  tool of certain AI coding agents, restricted CI runners, macOS app
  sandboxes) set `UF_HIDDEN` on every file they create under
  `site-packages/`, and Python 3.14's `site.py` silently skips
  `.pth` files with that flag — making editable installs invisible.
  Two recovery commands documented (`chflags nohidden …` or
  `PYTHONPATH=…/src`); pinning to Python 3.12/3.13 also avoids it.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- **GitHub Release notes are now extracted from the right CHANGELOG
  section.** The awk script in `release.yml` used `$0 ~ "## [<ver>]"`,
  where the brackets got interpreted as a regex character class, so no
  line ever matched and every release shipped with the fallback
  `Release X. See CHANGELOG.md for details.` text. Switched to
  `index($0, target) == 1` for a literal anchored-at-start string match
  that doesn't depend on regex metacharacters. Verified locally against
  every section in this changelog.

### Verified (no code change)

- **Vertex AI Express keys (`AQ.` prefix) work end-to-end through the
  google-genai SDK** — both embedding (already known) and LLM
  generation. The earlier worry that Vertex requires a manual
  `role: "user"` wrapper applies only to direct HTTP calls; the SDK
  handles it transparently in both AI Studio and Vertex modes. All 4
  Gemini-dependent integration tests now pass (15/15 integration tests
  green when `LLM_API_KEY` is supplied).
- **`seamless-rag --help`, `init`, `schema` (on empty table), `export`,
  and `benchmark` load zero provider modules** (no torch, no
  google-genai, no openai) — audited via `sys.modules` inspection. So
  `pip install seamless-rag[mariadb]` is a viable minimal install for
  read-only / SQL-export use cases; embedders are only loaded by the
  commands that actually need them (`embed`, `watch`, `ingest`, `ask`).

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-09

First tag-driven release through the new `release.yml` GitHub Actions
pipeline. No code changes versus 0.1.4 — this version exists to verify
the full publish path end-to-end (verify tag matches pyproject → build
→ twine check → PyPI upload via `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret → GitHub
Release with notes auto-extracted from this changelog).

If you're already on 0.1.4 there is no functional reason to upgrade.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- **Chunker now handles structured / non-prose input.** `seamless-rag ingest`
  previously used a sentence-only splitter, so any text without `.!?` (TSV,
  CSV, log, code, JSON-lines) was returned as a single giant chunk and
  `--chunk-size` was silently ignored. The chunker is now recursive:
  sentences → newlines → fixed character windows, the standard pattern used
  by LangChain and llama-index. Locked in by 6 regression tests in
  `tests/unit/test_cli.py::TestChunkText`.
- **`seamless-rag init` no longer requires the embedding provider package.**
  It used to load the configured embedder just to read its dimension; now
  reads `EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` from settings (default 384). Means
  `pip install seamless-rag[mariadb]` is enough for `init` and `schema` —
  no need to also install ~500 MB of PyTorch.
- **LLM provider failures are no longer swallowed.** When `LLM_PROVIDER=gemini`
  but the `google-genai` SDK is missing, `seamless-rag ask` used to print
  retrieval context and exit 0 with no answer. Now the underlying
  `ImportError` propagates with an actionable install hint
  (`pip install "seamless-rag[gemini]"`) and the CLI exits non-zero.

### Changed

- **Single source of truth for `__version__`.** Reads from
  `importlib.metadata` so it cannot desync from `pyproject.toml`. Bumping
  the package version now requires changing exactly one file.
- **All optional-extra import sites raise actionable `ImportError`.** When
  the relevant SDK is missing, `gemini`/`openai`/`sentence-transformers`
  imports now raise a self-contained message that names the right
  `pip install seamless-rag[<extra>]` plus alternative providers — same
  pattern that already shipped for the `mariadb` C-extension driver.

### Added

- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`.** Pushing a `v*.*.*` tag now drives
  the full release: verify tag matches `pyproject.toml`, build sdist +
  wheel, `twine check`, upload to PyPI (token-based today, with a
  documented OIDC migration path), and create the matching GitHub
  Release with notes pulled from this changelog. No more manual
  `python -m build && twine upload`.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- Friendly `ImportError` for the `mariadb` Python driver so users without
  Connector/C see actionable install hints instead of a raw
  `ModuleNotFoundError`.

### Fixed
- `Settings(extra="ignore")` so non-Seamless-RAG entries in `.env`
  (e.g. `TWINE_PASSWORD`) don't break startup.
- Lazy import of `SeamlessRAG` from the package root so bare
  `import seamless_rag` works without the optional `[mariadb]` extra.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-09

First publishable PyPI release.

### Added
- Vertex AI Express Mode auto-detection: API keys with the `AQ.` prefix
  route through Vertex AI; `AIza…` keys keep using Google AI Studio. No
  separate flag.
- Full PyPI metadata (keywords, classifiers, project URLs) for
  discoverability under MariaDB ecosystem listings.
- README "One-Line Agent Setup" section + `Install.md` for AI coding
  agents (DeerFlow-style bootstrap doc).
- Public agent skills under `skills/public/` (`seamless-rag` and
  `text-to-sql`).

### Fixed
- `mariadb` driver moved back to optional `[mariadb]` extra (it's a
  C-extension that needs system headers; making it required broke
  `pip install seamless-rag` on machines without Connector/C).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-08

Initial development release. **Do not use** — `pip install seamless-rag`
fails because of the import-time `mariadb` C-extension dependency. Fixed
in 0.1.2 / 0.1.3.
